## Software Design Decisions

1. Maven for my project structure type
2. Spring 2.7.3 (Spring 3.0.0(SNAPSHOT) and 2.7.4(SNAPSHOT) are work in progress). I prefer stable versions.
2. Java Version 11 (Java has support until 2026 and is the last LTS (Long-Time Support) available.
3. Springdoc-openapi v1.6.11 (I always use Swagger for project requirements, but I chose Openapi for learning (no big deal and the basic configuration is simple).) 
4. MongoDB as requiered
